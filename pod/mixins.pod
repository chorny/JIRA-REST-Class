=internal_method B<jira>

Returns a L<JIRA::REST::Class> object with credentials for the last JIRA user.

=internal_method B<factory>

An accessor for the L<JIRA::REST::Class::Factory>.

=internal_method B<JIRA_REST>

An accessor that returns the L<JIRA::REST> object being used.

=internal_method B<REST_CLIENT>

An accessor that returns the L<REST::Client> object inside the L<JIRA::REST> object being used.

=internal_method B<JSON>

An accessor that returns the L<JSON> object inside the L<JIRA::REST> object being used.

=internal_method B<make_object>

A pass-through method that calls L<JIRA::REST::Class::Factory::make_object()|JIRA::REST::Class::Factory/make_object>.

=internal_method B<make_date>

A pass-through method that calls L<JIRA::REST::Class::Factory::make_date()|JIRA::REST::Class::Factory/make_date>.

=internal_method B<class_for>

A pass-through method that calls L<JIRA::REST::Class::Factory::get_factory_class()|JIRA::REST::Class::Factory/get_factory_class>.

=internal_method B<obj_isa>

When passed a scalar that I<could> be an object and a class string,
returns whether the scalar is, in fact, an object of that class.
Looks up the actual class using C<class_for()>, which calls
L<JIRA::REST::Class::Factory::get_factory_class()|JIRA::REST::Class::Factory/get_factory_class>.

=method B<name_for_user>

When passed a scalar that could be a L<JIRA::REST::Class::User>
object, returns the name of the user if it is a
C<JIRA::REST::Class::User> object, or the unmodified scalar if it is
not.

=method B<key_for_issue>

When passed a scalar that could be a L<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue>
object, returns the key of the issue if it is a
C<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue> object, or the unmodified scalar if it is
not.

=method B<find_link_name_and_direction>

When passed two scalars, one that could be a
L<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue::LinkType> object and another that is a
direction (inward/outward), returns the name of the link type and
direction if it is a C<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue::LinkType> object, or
attempts to determine the link type and direction from the provided
scalars.

=method B<dump>

Returns a stringified representation of the object's data generated somewhat
by L<Data::Dumper::Concise>, but not descending into any objects that might
be part of that data.  If it finds objects in the data, it will attempt to
represent them in some abbreviated fashion which may not display all the
data in the object.  For instance, if the object has a
C<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue> object in it for an issue with the key
C<'JRC-1'>, the object would be represented as the string
C<< 'JIRA::REST::Class::Issue->key(JRC-1)' >>.  The goal is to provide a
gist of what the contents of the object are without exhaustively dumping
EVERYTHING.  I use it a lot for figuring out what's in the results I'm
getting back from the JIRA API.

=internal_method B<cosmetic_copy> I<THING>

A utility function to produce a "cosmetic" copy of a thing: it clones
the data structure, but if anything in the structure (other than the
structure itself) is a blessed object, it replaces it with a
stringification of that object that probably doesn't contain all the
data in the object.  For instance, if the object has a
C<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue> object in it for an issue with the key
C<'JRC-1'>, the object would be represented as the string
C<< 'JIRA::REST::Class::Issue->key(JRC-1)' >>.  The goal is to provide a
gist of what the contents of the object are without exhaustively dumping
EVERYTHING.
