=head1 JIRA-REST-Class

An OO Class module dealing with JIRA issues and their data as objects.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An OO Class module built atop L<JIRA::REST> for dealing with JIRA issues and
their data as objects.

This code is a work in progress, so it's bound to be incomplete.  I add methods
to it as I discover I need them.  I have also coded for fields that might exist
in my JIRA server's configuration but not in yours.  It is my I<intent>,
however, to make things more generic as I go on so they will "just work" no
matter how your server is configured.
