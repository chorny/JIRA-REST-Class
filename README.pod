=head1 JIRA-REST-Class

An OO Class module built atop JIRA::REST for dealing with JIRA issues and their data as objects.

This code is a work in progress, so it's bound to be incomplete.  I add methods to it as I discover I need them.

=head1 ABOUT

L<JIRA|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira> is a proprietary bug
tracking system from

This module is a medium-sized wrapper around 
L<JIRA::REST|https://github.com/gnustavo/JIRA-REST>, which is itself
a thin wrapper around L<JIRA's REST
API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/>.
