=head1 NAME

JIRA::REST::Class::Issue::Transitions - A helper class for L<JIRA::REST::Class|JIRA::REST::Class> that represents the state transitions a JIRA issue can go through.  Currently assumes a state diagram consisting of Open/In Progress/Resolved/Reopened/In QA/Verified/Closed.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.09

=head1 METHODS

=head2 B<transitions>

Returns an array of
L<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue::Transitions::Transition|JIRA::REST::Class::Issue::Transitions::Transition>
objects representing the transitions the issue can currently go through.

=head2 B<find_transition_named>

Returns the transition object for the named transition provided.

=head2 B<block>

Blocks the issue.

=head2 B<close>

Closes the issue.

=head2 B<verify>

Verifies the issue.

=head2 B<resolve>

Resolves the issue.

=head2 B<reopen>

Reopens the issue.

=head2 B<start_progress>

Starts progress on the issue.

=head2 B<stop_progress>

Stops progress on the issue.

=head2 B<start_qa>

Starts QA on the issue.

=head2 B<transition_walk>

This method takes three unnamed parameters:
  + The name of the end target issue status
  + A hashref mapping possible current states to intermediate states
    that will progress the issue towards the end target issue status
  + A callback subroutine reference that will be called after each
    transition with the name of the current issue state and the name
    of the state it is transitioning to (defaults to an empty subroutine
    reference).

=head1 READ-ONLY ACCESSORS

=head2 B<issue>

The L<JIRA::REST::Class::Issue|JIRA::REST::Class::Issue> object this is a
transition for.

it will not be in the transition metadata, and a field validation error will
occur if it is submitted.
